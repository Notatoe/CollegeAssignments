To run AES.cpp you need to compile it using the terminal command "g++ AES.cpp -o AES" and then you can run it with "./AES". The program will print out everything into the terminal.

For this project I mainy used the resources provided, however I did look to the internet a few times. Once was for making the Rcon array as the I struggled a bit with the FIPS documentation with it. Most of the other times though it was mainly to refresh myself with c++ libraries and syntax.

As for Appendix C, my program matches exactly what was given in Appendix C with the one exception being equivalent inverse cipher, but we were not required to complete equivalent inverse cipher.
